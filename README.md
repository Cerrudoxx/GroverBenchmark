# Grover Benchmark

This repository contains the source code developed for my TFG (Trabajo de Fin de Grado) focused on the simulation of quantum circuits using multiple quantum computing frameworks: Qsimov, Qibo, Qiskit, and Qulacs. The project explores the performance of these simulators, measuring execution times and memory consumption using Grover's algorithm.

## Project Overview
The TFG investigates the scalability and efficiency of quantum circuit simulations on classical hardware. Key aspects include:
- **Simulation Frameworks**: Comparative analysis of Qsimov, Qibo, Qiskit, and Qulacs.
- **Metrics**: Execution time and memory usage for circuits with different numbers of qubits and cores.
- **Methodology**: Python scripts automate circuit creation, execution, and performance logging, with results visualized in graphs.
- **Results**: Detailed in the accompanying TFG document (available upon request), with code supporting the experimental data.

## Repository Structure
- `qsimov/`: Qsimov simulation scripts and specific instructions.
- `qibo/`: Qibo simulation scripts and specific instructions.
- `qiskit/`: Qiskit simulation scripts and specific instructions.
- `qulacs/`: Qulacs simulation scripts and specific instructions.

Each simulator folder (`qsimov/`, `qibo/`, `qiskit/`, `qulacs/`) includes a `README.md` file with detailed instructions on how to set up, run, and interpret the respective code.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tfg-quantum-simulations.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure Python and the required libraries (e.g., `qsimov`, `qibo`, `qiskit`, `qulacs`, `numpy`, `time`) are installed. Refer to each simulatorâ€™s `README.md` for specific requirements.
3. **Run the Scripts**: Follow the instructions in the respective simulator folders to execute the simulations.
4. **View Results**: Graphs and data are generated as part of the execution or referenced in the TFG document.
